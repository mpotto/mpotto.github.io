## About Me

I am a second-year PhD Student in the Department of Statistics at University of Washington, advised by Professor [Zaid Harchaoui](https://sites.google.com/uw.edu/zaid-harchaoui/main?authuser=0). I am broadly interested in machine learning, optimization, and non-asymptotic statistics. My current research focuses on representation learning with applications to language and signal processing.

I was previously a Master's student at the Interinstitutional Graduate Program in Statistics at the University of São Paulo and the Federal University of São Carlos, advised by [Rafael Izbicki](https://rafaelizbicki.com).
